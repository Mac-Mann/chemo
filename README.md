Chemo rids your Windows 10 machine of the pre-installed junk you don't want. We
can't guarantee that it will stay gone forever, but you may always come back for
another round of treatment, if you desire.

## System Requirements

 - Windows 10

Note: This program is designed strictly for Windows 10. Use on other versions
Microsoft Windows is not supported.
